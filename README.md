# Prime Factorization & Power Set Explorer

Welcome to the **Prime Factorization & Power Set Explorer** - a playful, yet powerful, tool for diving deep into the fascinating world of numbers and set theory! This Python-based program not only computes the prime factors of a given number but also generates the power set of those factors and visualizes every possible way the number can be factored using its subsets. Whether you're a math enthusiast, a student, or just love to tinker with algorithms, this interactive command-line tool is for you.

## üöÄ Features

- **Prime Factorization:**  
  Break down any integer into its prime components with an efficient iterative approach.

- **Power Set Generation:**  
  Leverage Python's `itertools.combinations` to generate all subsets (the power set) of any given set of numbers.

- **Factorization Chart:**  
  Visualize all possible factorizations by matching subsets of prime factors with the corresponding complementary factors, presented in an easy-to-read chart.

- **Interactive Menu:**  
  Enjoy an engaging, menu-driven interface that guides you through factorization, power set generation, and more.

## üîß Installation

Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bjmickens/Prime_Factors.git
   cd Prime_Factors

2. **Run the Program:**

   ```bash
   python PrimeFactors.py

## üìñ Usage

When you run the program, you'll be greeted with an interactive menu:
1. **Find Prime Factors:**
   Input a number, and the program will display its prime factors
2. **Find Power Set:**
   Provide a set or numbers (space-separated), and see the complete power set for exploration.
3. **List All Factorings and Subsets:**
   Combine both functionalities: compute the prime factors or a number and then view all possible factorizations paired with the corresponding power set subsets. 
4. **Exit:**
   End your session gracefully.

Enjoy experimenting with different numbers and discover the underlying beauty of discrete mathematics!

## üéØ Example

For instance, when you input the number **12**:

- **Prime Factors:** The program will output `[2, 2, 3]`.
- **Factorization Chart:** It will generate a table listing each subset of prime factors (including the empty set) and show how the product of the subset relates to the original number.
